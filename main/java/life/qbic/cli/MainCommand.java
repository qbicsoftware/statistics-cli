    // IMPORTANT: Typically you won't require a fancy constructor, but if you do, you must know that
    //            ToolExecutor requires that all command classes contain a public constructor that takes no arguments.
    //
    //            If you need a custom constructor, make sure to provide a no-arguments public constructor as well.
    //            See: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/constructors.html
